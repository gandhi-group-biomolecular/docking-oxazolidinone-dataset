# Oxazolidinone dataset for ribsomal docking (freely available)
Dataset for oxazolidnones for docking and virtual screening in ribosomal targets
If you plan to use this dataset for your study, please reference the paper: *INSERT PAPER REFERENCE HERE*

This dataset is comprised of 285 oxazolidinone and linezolid deriviates. All are listed in mol2 format.

Structures were taken, drawn, and converted into mol2 format from Zhao et al.'s review paper "_Current Landscape and Future Perspective of Oxazolidinone Scaffolds Containing Antibacterial Drugs_": https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00480

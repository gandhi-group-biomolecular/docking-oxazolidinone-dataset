# Oxazolidinone dataset for ribsomal docking
This repository contains the dataset for oxazolidnones for docking and virtual screening in ribosomal targets.
If you plan to use this dataset for your study, please reference the paper: *Comparative Assessment of Docking Programs for Docking and Virtual Screening of Ribosomal Oxazolidinone Antibacterial Agents* https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12030463

This dataset is comprised of 285 oxazolidinone and linezolid deriviates. All are listed in mol2 format and SMILES.

Structures were taken, drawn, and converted into mol2 format from Zhao et al.'s review paper "_Current Landscape and Future Perspective of Oxazolidinone Scaffolds Containing Antibacterial Drugs_": https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00480

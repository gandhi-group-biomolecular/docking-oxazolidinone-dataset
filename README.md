This dataset is comprised of 285 oxazolidinone and linezolid deriviates. All are listed in mol2 format.

Strucutures were taken, drawn, and converted into mol2 format from Zhao et al.'s review paper "Current Landscape and Future Perspective of Oxazolidinone Scaffolds Containing Antibacterial Drugs": https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00480
